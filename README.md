Recreation of the game Battle City 1985 in Godot, with improved and expanded gameplay, without the limitations of the original game.

All rights reserved to Namco, this is a fangame made by a fan.

## About the game

We have the original Battle City gameplay with the same objective: defend your base from enemies.

Play with one or more tanks, upgrade them, and use special bonuses to defend your base at all costs!

Supports up to 4 simultaneous players.

## Gameplay

### Campaign
The original Battle City campaign with 35 original levels + 35 enhanced levels + 30 new levels, totaling 100 levels! Each completed level is available in Freeplay.

### Freeplay
Choose a level from the unlocked levels to play freely or continue your campaign from where you left off, but without it counting towards your high score (requires "Freeplay to Campaign" to be active).

### Custom Levels
Choose from levels you or someone else created to play freely.

### Survival
Choose a specific level and survive as many rounds as you can, enduring the gradually increasing difficulty level as you progress in this endless game mode.

## Options

### Freeplay to campaign
allows you to go from a chosen level in freeplay to campaign mode. It does not count towards the Highscore but unlocks new levels for freeplay.

### Bots use bonus
allows bots to use special bonuses against you, to become stronger or weaken your defenses.

### Hard mode
Increases the game's difficulty as follows: enemy tanks have random shield levels (except for heavy tanks) and move slightly faster. In return, 2 special bonuses are generated at once and the tank's level cap increases by +1 star.

### Auto fire
Allows you to fire automatically simply by holding down the fire button, without having to press it to shoot.

### Language
Choose a general language from those currently available, which are English, Español and Português.

### Gamepads
Configure each player's buttons, with keyboard and controller support.

## Construction Mode
Create new levels or edit an existing level to play in Custom Levels mode or share it with others.

Add bricks, walls, river, bushes and ice as you like, move the spawn location of players and bots freely and when selecting a base, move it with the directional pad in the desired direction.

Define the level name, bot types, total number of bots and spawn interval to save your level available in Custom Levels mode.
